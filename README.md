#Bezel lock screen

The aim of this project is to develop a prototype for a new type of lock screen for 
mobile phones. Taking inspiration from the paper “User Learning and Performance with Bezel Menus” (Jain M. and Balakrishnan R.) we decided to develop and test a prototype for a lock screen that requires the user to input a numeric PIN code using bezel gesture to enter each digit. The prototype was developed as a Javascript application so the code could be run and tested on iPhones and Android smartphones.
